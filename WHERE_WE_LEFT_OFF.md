## ⏳ REMAINING TASKS (5 minutes total)

### Task 1: Configure Railway Environment Variables (2 min)
**Why:** Railway needs environment variables to run the backend properly

**What to do:**
1. Open: https://railway.com/project/73ebf38b-9521-4dec-ba0d-558280a576b5
2. Click on the service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add these 11 variables (see `FINAL_STEPS.md` for exact values):
   - NODE_ENV
   - PORT
   - JWT_SECRET
   - JWT_EXPIRES_IN
   - UPLOAD_DIR
   - MAX_FILE_SIZE
   - CORS_ORIGIN
   - SFTP_HOST
   - SFTP_PORT
   - SFTP_ROOT_PATH
   - SFTP_API_KEY

5. Go to Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
6. **SAVE THE RAILWAY URL** (you'll need it for Task 2)

---

### Task 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (3 min)
**Why:** Need to deploy the React frontend

**What to do:**
1. Open: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import repository: `nickd290/abt-warranty-portal`
3. Configure:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Root: . (leave as root)
   - Build: npm run build
   - Output: dist
4. Add 3 environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = Your Railway URL from Task 1
   - `VITE_SFTP_HOST` = `134.199.195.90`
   - `VITE_SFTP_PORT` = `22`
5. Deploy!
6. **SAVE THE VERCEL URL**

---

### Task 3: Update CORS (30 seconds)
**Why:** Backend needs to allow requests from your Vercel frontend

**What to do:**
1. Go back to Railway Variables
2. Edit `CORS_ORIGIN` variable
3. Change to your Vercel URL from Task 2
4. Save (Railway auto-redeploys)

---

## 🎯 WHEN YOU RESUME

### Start Here:
1. Open `FINAL_STEPS.md` in your project root
2. It has all the exact values ready to copy-paste
3. Follow the 3 tasks above

### Test When Done:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Login: `admin@abtwarranty.com` / `admin123`
3. Click around to verify it works
4. **Change the admin password!**

## 💡 QUICK NOTES

### What's Working:
- Local development is fully functional
- Backend is deployed but needs environment variables configured
- Database is ready with seeded data
- All code is in GitHub

### What's Not Done:
- Railway environment variables not set (need to do manually in UI)
- Frontend not yet deployed to Vercel
- CORS not yet configured

### Why Not Fully Automated:
The Railway and Vercel CLIs require interactive authentication that doesn't work in non-interactive mode. The web dashboards are actually faster and easier - just copy-paste the values from `FINAL_STEPS.md`.

### Estimated Time to Complete:
- Railway config: 2 minutes
- Vercel deploy: 3 minutes
- CORS update: 30 seconds
- **Total: 5-6 minutes**

## 📊 Cost Breakdown

- **Railway:** $5/month (Hobby) or $20/month (Pro)
- **Vercel:** FREE (Hobby tier)
- **Total:** $5-20/month

---

## 🔄 Future Updates

Once everything is deployed:
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub main branch
3. Railway auto-deploys backend
4. Vercel auto-deploys frontend
5. Both should update within 2-3 minutes

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend won't start on Railway:
- Check that all 11 environment variables are set
- Check Railway logs for specific error
- DATABASE_URL should be automatically provided

### Frontend shows network errors:
- Check VITE_API_URL points to Railway URL
- Check Railway backend is running (green status)
- Check CORS_ORIGIN is set to your Vercel URL

### Can't login:
- Database should have admin@abtwarranty.com
- Password is: admin123
- Check Railway logs to confirm seed ran

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

When you're done, you should have:
- [ ] Railway backend running with all variables set
- [ ] Railway domain generated and saved
- [ ] Vercel frontend deployed
- [ ] Vercel URL saved
- [ ] CORS_ORIGIN updated in Railway
- [ ] Can login at Vercel URL
- [ ] Changed admin password
